# Hilton Compass
## Developed by Sebastian Rosado

Key for this page:
- 'Hilton Experimental Design Project' - The full data analysis project I carried out on the Booking.com dataset.
- 'app.py' - The main code for Hilton Compass, the Plotly Dash app that accompanies the project.
- 'countries_trimmed.csv' - Dataset used for the App, refined from the original Booking.com dataset.
- Every other file on this page enables the Hilton Compass app to look like it does.
